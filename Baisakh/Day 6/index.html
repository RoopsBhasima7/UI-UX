      Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as
      Nepal.[c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears
      in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century
      BC.[which?] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the
      oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the
      early modern period. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are
      hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient
      understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman
      languages.

      By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian
      subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[28][29][30] The
      earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000
      years ago.[31] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human
      settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.

      Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long
      and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq
      mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E.
      Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the
      Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a
      north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and
      later, south and south-east.

      Energy Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Dam. Nepal has significant
      potential to generate hydropower, which it plans to export across South
      Asia. The bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported
      fossil fuels (16%).[229] Most of the final energy consumption goes to the
      residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the
      transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent
      years.[229] Except for some lignite deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas
      or coal deposits.[229] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and
      coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export
      revenue.[230] Only about 1% of the energy need is fulfilled by
      electricity.[229] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep
      gradient of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the
      development of hydroelectric projects. Estimates put Nepal's economically
      feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW.[229] Nepal has
      been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW. As most of it is generated from
      run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much lower in the
      dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and
      Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the
      demands.[231] Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and
      setbacks.[232][233][234] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable
      to that of other countries in the region but there is significant
      disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas.[229] The position
      of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high
      system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and
      lower domestic demand.

      Society Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social
      hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social
      stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia.
      Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary
      groups, often termed as jātis, or "castes". Nepal declared untouchability
      to be illegal in 1963[296] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory
      laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational
      institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much
      lost its importance.[citation needed] Family values are important in the
      Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have
      been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in
      urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Nepalis, with or without their
      consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family
      elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is
      extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in
      divorce.[297] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many
      women wed before reaching 18.[298] Many Nepali festivals are religious in
      origin. The best known include: Dashain, Tihar, Teej, Chhath, Maghi,
      Sakela, Holi, Eid ul-Fitr, Christmas, and the Nepali new year.
