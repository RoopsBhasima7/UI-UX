          Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a
          landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the
          Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It
          borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India
          to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from
          Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian
          state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile
          plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest
          mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth.
          Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a
          multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state,
          with Nepali as the official language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of
          the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was
          founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the
          first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born
          in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined
          with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is
          intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the
          prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan
          branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders.
          The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and
          architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the
          unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of
          Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its
          Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served
          as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India.
          Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended
          by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the
          1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular
          republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a
          secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces.
          Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship
          treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts
          the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional
          Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a
          member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative.
          The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are
          notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars,
          and have been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping
          operations.

          Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as
          Nepal.[c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal
          appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the
          fourth century BC.[which?] An absolute chronology can not be
          established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous
          contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic
          attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a
          complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of
          linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.[17]
          According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient
          Hindu sage called Ne, referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi.
          According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne, the country
          in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d]
          According to Nepāl Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of
          the country by Pashupati.[20] According to Buddhist mythology,
          Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create
          the Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of
          the community that would settle it. As the cherished of Ne, the valley
          would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali, the
          genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c.1380s, Nepal is named
          after Nepa the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the
          Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at
          which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon
          investigation, was also named Ne.[17] Norwegian indologist Christian
          Lassen had proposed that Nepāla was a compound of Nipa (foot of a
          mountain) and -ala (short suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so
          Nepāla meant "abode at the foot of the mountain". He considered Ne
          Muni to be a fabrication.[22] Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen's
          theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that
          either Newara is a vulgarism of sanskritic Nepala, or Nepala is
          Sanskritisation of the local ethnic;[23] his view has found some
          support though it does not answer the question of
          etymology.[24][25][26][17] It has also been proposed that Nepa is a
          Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of Ne (cattle) and Pa (keeper),
          reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas
          (cowherds) and Mahispalas (buffalo-herds).[17] Suniti Kumar Chatterji
          believed Nepal originated from Tibeto-Burman roots - Ne, of uncertain
          meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal, whose
          meaning is lost entirely.[27]

          By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian
          subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[28][29][30]
          The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about
          30,000 years ago.[31] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of
          human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[32]
        </p>
        <p>
          After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and
          animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of
          agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is
          now Balochistan.[33] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley
          civilisation,[34][33] the first urban culture in South Asia.[35]
          Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins
          have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[36] The
          earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed
          to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation. It is possible that
          the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze
          Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area
          before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and
          Indo-Aryans from across the border.[37] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese
          people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from
          Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both.[38] Stella
          Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and
          Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the
          majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[39]
        </p>
        <p>
          By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu
          texts, such as the late Vedic Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the
          post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[40] The Gopal Bansa was the
          oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers
          of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[41] The
          Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16 centuries by
          some accounts.[42] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king
          went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern
          region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the prosperous kingdom of
          Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King
          Janaka and his daughter, Sita.

          Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi)
          long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with an area of 147,516 km2
          (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes
          80° and 89°E. Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million
          years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern
          supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by
          seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and
          south-east.[75] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its
          northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[75] These dual
          processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created
          the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to
          under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[75] The rising
          barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only
          broke through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys
          in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the western region,
          rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's
          deepest gorges.[76] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate
          movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne
          sediment[77] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[78] Nepal
          lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the
          central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km
          (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas,[79][80][81][82][83][84] with a small strip
          of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two
          districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[76]

          Nepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as
          Himal-Pahad-Terai.[g] Himal is the mountain region containing snow and
          situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part
          of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including
          8,848.86 metres (29,032 ft) height Mount Everest (Sagarmāthā in
          Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world's
          "eight-thousanders" are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse,
          Makalu, Cho Oyu, Kangchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu.
          Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The
          mountains vary from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,600 to 13,100 ft) in
          altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200
          metres (3,900 ft) to alpine climates above 3,600 metres (11,800 ft).
          The Lower Himalayan Range, reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres (4,900 to
          9,800 ft), is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical
          river valleys and "hills" alternating to the north of this range.
          Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000
          metres (6,600 ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,200 ft), where
          snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or
          Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the
          Indo-Gangetic Plain. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill
          ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan
          rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the Karnali as well as smaller
          rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a
          subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills
          called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range, cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres
          (2,300 to 3,280 ft), marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain. Broad,
          low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys (Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka) lie
          north of these foothills in several places.

          The Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about 50
          mm (2.0 in) per year.[85] This makes Nepal an earthquake-prone zone,
          and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences present a
          significant hurdle to development.[86] Erosion of the Himalayas is a
          very important source of sediment, which flows to the Indian
          Ocean.[87] Saptakoshi, in particular, carries a huge amount of silt
          out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in Bihar, causing
          severe floods and course changes, and is, therefore, known as the
          sorrow of Bihar. Severe flooding and landslides cause deaths and
          disease, destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of
          the country, during the monsoon season each year.
